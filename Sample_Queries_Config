9)Is there a correlation between the ratio of the population in cities that are adolescents and the price of Airbnbs ? For each city, list the city name, the ratio of the population that are in grades K-12, and the maximum price of an Airbnb in that city. Are cities with children cheaper or more expensive?

INNER JOIN airbnb_max_cost A ON C.city = A.city;

10) Out of all restaurants in cities where the AQI indexes are less than X, find the restaurants that happen to be vegan, but not Michelin star, and where the stay per night is less than 200 dollars.
